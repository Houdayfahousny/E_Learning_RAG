      "script": "Hello everyone! Today we're going to explore the syntax of Java. In the previous chapter, we created a Java file called Main.java and used some code to print \"Hello World\" to the console. Now, let's dive deeper into the basics of Java syntax. Firstly, **point 1**: In Java, we use semicolons (;) to terminate statements. This is similar to other programming languages like C or C++. Let me show you an example: `System.out.println(\"Hello World!\");`. As you can see, we're using a semicolon at the end of the statement."
